# Busybox Kernel Headers
Read repo root README.md for an explanation of what this is.

## Origin
This patch comes from the patch set at https://github.com/sabotage-linux/kernel-headers/tree/4.4.2/patches but is slightly modified to fit a 6.4 kernel. Note that patch 2 in that set fails but can be ignored, patch 4, 6 and 8 partially works and partially needs some merge conflict resolving. All of this is combined into one patch in this repo. It would probably be better to offer a complete new patch set, oh well...

## License
The same license as for the original source files apply, i.e. "GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note".
